## Contributing

### Issues

In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using [the issue tracker](
https://github.com/narenkukreja/quire/issues). If you don't see your issue (or you
aren't sure) feel free to [submit it!](https://github.com/narenkukreja/quire/issues)

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

### Code

If you are a developer and wish to contribute to the app please fork the project
and submit a pull request.
